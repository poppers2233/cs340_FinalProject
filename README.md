# cs340_FinalProject
This repository contains a zip file containing a fully functional cs340 ( Intro to data bases) final project at Oregon State University.
The code is free to use for anyone who might deem it useful.
It is a database based insertion/deletion/updating webservice utilizing node.js.
Apologies for this repository containing a zip file instead of the normal repository hierarchy.
Any concerns email me @ mugicaj@oregonstate.edu.
